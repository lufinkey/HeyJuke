## The Project
When music plays at a social event, disagreement can arise over what music should be played. Even if there isn't, 
it can be complicated to change the music. Smart home devices like an Amazon Echo or Google Home can only use one streaming 
account at a time, which can also cause issues in an age of big data, when the music streamed can affect future recommendations. 

HeyJuke is a solution for creating a music playlist that can be collaborated on easily by anyone present. Whether by uploading
music or queuing up streamed music using their own accounts, HeyJuke will allow easy queuing from a number of services. 

## Skills
Our team has experience in app development, full stack development, and hardware. 

## The Final Product
We will create a small server that can be connected to over a local network from mobile devices on the network. This server
will be able to plug into a speaker system and play music queued by the users. We plan to be able to play files, music from the 
Spotify API, and audio from YouTube.
