## Project Sought

I would like the opportunity to create something that I personally would use in my daily life. I have several potential ideas, but have not setted on one yet:
- A jukebox web server that can be used at parties to allow anyone in the room to queue songs to and vote on songs
- A scripting language that can be both interpreted *or* transpiled to C++ and then compiled
